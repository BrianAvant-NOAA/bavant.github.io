US EPA Region 4 and the National Water Quality Modeling Work Group is proud to sponsor a 5-day workshop on water quality principles/modeling using the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP). WASP is one of the most widely used water quality models in the US and throughout the world. With an estimated 10,000+ installed user base, the model is continually being enhanced to meet the needs of the user community. 
WASP can be applied to streams, rivers, lakes/reservoirs, and estuaries in 1, 2 or 3 dimensions. WASP is used routinely throughout the United States in the development of TMDLs and waste load allocations.
